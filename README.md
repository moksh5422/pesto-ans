## Data Ingestion

To handle the high volume of data from various sources, I recommend using a distributed ingestion system. Here's a possible architecture:

* **Apache Kafka**: Use Kafka as the messaging queue to handle real-time data ingestion from ad impressions, clicks, and conversions. Create separate topics for each data source.
* **Apache NiFi**: Use NiFi to ingest data from CSV and Avro files, and route it to Kafka topics.
* **Kafka Connect**: Use Kafka Connect to ingest JSON data from ad impressions and route it to Kafka topics.

## Data Processing

To process and transform the data, I recommend using a distributed processing engine. Here's a possible architecture:

* **Apache Spark**: Use Spark to process data from Kafka topics. Implement data transformation processes to standardize and enrich the data.
* **Data Validation**: Use Spark's built-in data validation features to handle data validation, filtering, and deduplication.
* **Data Correlation**: Implement logic to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions using Spark's join and aggregation features.

## Data Storage and Query Performance

To store processed data efficiently and enable fast querying, I recommend using a columnar storage system. Here's a possible architecture:

* **Apache Parquet**: Use Parquet as the storage format for processed data. Parquet is optimized for columnar storage and querying.
* **Apache Hive**: Use Hive as the data warehousing solution to store processed data in Parquet format. Hive provides a SQL-like interface for querying data.
* **Apache Presto**: Use Presto as the query engine to enable fast querying and aggregations of ad campaign data.

## Error Handling and Monitoring

To detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays, I recommend using a monitoring and alerting system. Here's a possible architecture:

* **Apache Kafka Streams**: Use Kafka Streams to monitor data flows and detect anomalies in real-time.
* **Apache Airflow**: Use Airflow to schedule data quality checks and monitoring tasks.
* **Alerting Mechanisms**: Implement alerting mechanisms using tools like PagerDuty or Slack to notify teams of data quality issues.
